                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">In 2023, Bethsaida Secondary School witnessed an outstanding academic performance, with an impressive 93% of students being selected to join Advanced Secondary Schools. This remarkable achievement represents a significant leap from previous years, showcasing the dedication and hard work of both students and teachers.

                    To put this in perspective, 2021 saw 59 students (59%) advance to higher education, followed by a surge in 2022 with 87 students making the transition. However, 2023 truly stands out, with 26 out of 29 students (90%) being selected due to their excellent performance, while only a small 7% were not selected.

                    This upward trajectory highlights the potential within our school, but it also underscores the need for continued support. With additional resources, we can ensure that this success becomes the norm for all students, regardless of financial barriers. Your support will help sustain and elevate this momentum, empowering more young minds to achieve their dreams and contribute positively to their communities.

                <p class="lead fw-normal text-muted mb-0">Bethsaida Secondary School has shown remarkable improvement in academic performance between 2021 and 2022. In 2021, 59 students, representing 59%, advanced to higher education and joined Advanced Secondary Schools. By 2022, this number surged significantly, with 87 students successfully passing and securing placements—an impressive increase of 47%.

                    This upward trend reflects the dedication of both students and teachers, as well as the growing support of our donors. However, while we celebrate this achievement, many students still face financial challenges that hinder their educational progress. With your continued support, we can ensure that every deserving student has the opportunity to pursue higher education and break the cycle of poverty through knowledge. Together, we can build on this progress and make even greater strides in the years to come. </div>
